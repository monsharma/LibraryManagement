XAML is mostly used to define the visual contents of a page and works together with a C# code-behind file.

When Visual Studio builds the project, it parses the XAML file to generate a C# code file. 
If we look in the XamlSamples\XamlSamples\obj\Debug directory, you’ll find a file named XamlSamples.MainPage.xaml.g.cs. 
The ‘g’ stands for generated. This is the other partial class definition of MainPage that contains the definition of the InitializeComponent 
method called from the MainPage constructor. 
These two partial MainPage class definitions can then be compiled together.
